#                                                                    #
# The Crystallographic Information File (CIF)[1] is a standard for   #
# information interchange promulgated by the International Union of  #
# Crystallography (IUCr). CIF (Hall, Allen & Brown, 1991) is the     #
# recommended method for submitting publications to Acta             #
# Crystallographica Section C and reports of crystal structure       #
# determinations to other sections of Acta Crystallographica         #
# and many other journals. The syntax of a CIF is a subset of the    #
# more general STAR File[2] format. The CIF and STAR File approaches #
# are used increasingly in the structural sciences for data exchange #
# and archiving, and are having a significant influence on these     #
# activities in other fields.                                        #
#                                                                    #

# The IUCr's interest in the STAR File is as a general data          #
# interchange standard for science, and its interest in the CIF,     #
# a conformant derivative of the STAR File, is as a concise data     #
# exchange and archival standard for crystallography and structural  #
# science.                                                           #
